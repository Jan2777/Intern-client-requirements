During my internship at, I acquired valuable skills and experience across various domains and here are some examples. My role involved extensive interactions with clients to understand and gather their requirements, which included working with geographic coordinates, image extraction, and data visualization. I developed dashboards to analyze customer spending patterns, card usage (such as gift and food cards), and loyalty metrics. This included creating detailed reports on customer behaviors, spending trends, and identifying areas where customers spend the most.  In addition to client-facing tasks, I worked on several machine learning and system integration projects. I trained and implemented machine learning models for vehicle type classification and number plate recognition. These models were integrated with GPS systems to facilitate automatic vehicle tracking and real-time processing. This involved refining algorithms to improve accuracy and performance, and ensuring seamless integration with existing systems.  A highlight of my internship was developing a chatbot for PayCentral, a South African bank. This chatbot was designed to enhance customer interactions by leveraging machine learning to handle a range of banking queries. This project required understanding user needs, implementing conversational AI, and ensuring that the chatbot provided accurate and helpful responses.  Another significant project I contributed to was the Vehicle Recognition for GPS Tracking system. This project applied advanced computer vision techniques, including YOLOv8 and EasyOCR, to classify vehicles and recognize number plates. The system integrated with GPS tracking to provide real-time vehicle monitoring, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.  Overall, my internship experience at Xenovex Technologies equipped me with a strong foundation in client interactions, data analysis, machine learning, and system integration, while contributing to impactful projects
